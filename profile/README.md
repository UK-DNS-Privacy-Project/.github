# About the UK DNS Privacy Project 🌐

Welcome to the GitHub organization for the UK DNS Privacy Project! 🎉 Our mission is to provide a free, privacy-focused DNS service that protects the online activity of UK internet users. We believe in transparency, security, and empowering users to take control of their online privacy. 🛡️

## What We Do ✨

Privacy-First DNS Services: 🕶️ We provide a DNS service that does not log, track, or share user data.

Encryption Standards: 🔒 Our DNS supports DNS-over-TLS (DoT) and DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH) to ensure secure and encrypted queries.

Open Collaboration: 🤝 We encourage open collaboration to improve our services and advocate for a more private internet.

## Get Involved 🚀

We are building an open, community-driven initiative and welcome contributions from developers, privacy advocates, and anyone who shares our vision.

### Future Plans 🌟

We aim to formalize our structure by becoming a Community Interest Company (CIC) and introducing options for memberships and sponsorships. These steps will help us grow sustainably and continue to serve the public good. 🤲
